# RvSnoop Features Roadmap

    $Id$

This file contains an overview of the planned features in future
versions of RvSnoop. Any alterations should be formatted using
[Markdown][MD] syntax.

## Release 1.6	

The target release date for 1.6 is late November, 2006. This means
that it should be into beta by the beginnning of that month.

### Build System Clean Up

Add in all of the planned dependencies, this should be no problem
because proguard will strip the classes at dist time until they are
used. This will let us selectively use classes as they are needed
(e.g. the tuple binding stuff from BDB).

Since proguard is no longer being used that isn't true any more. But
the build system needs altering to produce a single distributable
rather than separate source and binary versions.

### Add ‘Delete Connection’ Action

My current thinking on this to reqork the connection class to use a
separate list based class, not really a factory as it will not be
used for object creation, but a a class that handles activating and
deactivating connections.

* Add a connection list class (Connections)

  Which should be a singleton and, initially, be a regular event
  list. Maybe later it will need to become a grouped event list to
  should, e.g. EMS connections as well.

* Make the constructors for RvConnection public

  Validation of arguments shouldn't take place until added to the
  connection list. When a connection is added to the connection list
  it should check that a similarly configured connection does not
  already exist.

* Connections are inactive when not in the list

  Connections MUST be in the list before start/stop/pause can be
  called. Removing a connection from the list stops it.

This is pretty much done now, but needs to be tested. Still to do:
make the connection add/edit dialog binding based, also ensure that
it doesn't add things twice, or miss things from the recent
connections list, or anything else like that.

### Make Projects be Directory Based

With an rvsnoop-project.xml file, use the folder name for the
project name, add an rvsnoop-project.xml file for project metadata;
this should include record types and connections, in future it
should also store probes and any other project artifacts. There
should also be a subjects.xml file with the subject hierarchy in it.
Later we may want to add an undo-history.xml file with the undo
history in it.

An alternative approach would be to use multiple small files with
different types of data in each?

In either case, we need to have a migrator for the RSP file format.
This should create a new directory with the same name (sans the .rsp
extension), then migrate the contents of the rsp file to the various
project files.

Subfolders in the project could include...	

* messages

  For all of the message bodies and meta data, message bodies have a
  '.msg' extension, metadata files have .meta extension. Note: if
  timestamps are going to be stored as longs we will need to add
  timezone information to the project file.

* index

  For the lucense index files

### Add ConnectionList and MessageLedger Selection Events

Use these to enable/disable actions. This shoulod use
KeyboardFocusManager, and look at the way Eclipse handles focus
management for ideas.

### Sniff Opaques for Serialized Java Data

This should show some information about the serialized object and
allow methods to be invoked where they take no arguments, or only
primitive values. Probably just include viewing in this version.

### Remove MsgType from Record, Apply it Dynamically in Views

Also, allow user defined types. This needs to have a UI, based on a
list of "RecordTypePanel" or similar, with add/remove/up/down
buttons for the list. It will also need a dedicated dialog to
display this, and an action to put in the menu bar. Allow types to
be used in filters (and then remove the "type" submenu from the
view).

Rename MsgType to RecordType. Record types should be global or
project specific, global record types are stored in the general
preferences, project specific record types are stored in the
project.xml file. NO: this conflicts with the next idea... Allow
type names to be changes but check that the name is unique before
changing it.

Create a RecordTypePanel component to display information about a
RecordType. Create a RecordTypesDialog to display a list of
RecordTypePanels. NOTE: It turns out that this is a royal pain in
the ass to do, and 90% of the functionality can be had by using a
JTable instead so I'm going to do that for now. This needs
revisiting later to improve the user interface.

Use the Drag n' Ghost effect with a custom panel/layout manager
(based on Box/BoxLayout). The custom layout should just be a
copy-paste from the JDK sources but make the internal fields
accesible. NOTE: Keep the drag n' ghost effect but ditch the layout
manager idea.

### Check for Changes to the Config Files Before Saving

Use CRC32 or similar, hash on opening and save hash. If the hash is
different when we go to write the file pop a dialog asking for
confirmation.

### Add String Flavour Support to RecordSelectable

Use the marshaller to serialize records to strings. While we are at
it, allow unmarshalling directly from byte[] as well as
Transferrable; and enhance RecordSelection to support single
messages directly as well as in arrays of 1 message (i.e. without
the BIND_RECORD_SET_MAGIC header).

Some thought needs to be given as to how we will handle the default
copy behaviour, my current thinking is that the default should be to
copy byte streams (like it does now), but maybe add a menu option to
"copy as ..." for the different marshaller types.

A though occurs here that I should include a default XML
serialization format for messages, the ideal would be to agree a
format with Stefan then it can be shared between RvSnoop and
RvScript, probably the best approach would be to just use the
RvScript format but stuff it into a namespace, hopefully Stefan will
agree to use this approach in a new version of RvScript.

This may be a good time to get rid of the BDBJE dependency since we
are no longer planning to use it. At the moment it isn't doing
anything that DataInput/DataOutput couldn't do.

### Add Selectable Support to the Details Panel

To allow cut/paste of field values.

### Add A Column for Wire Size to the Message Ledger

This would mean adding a field for wire size to the record class,
there will be an impact on read performance, but it is something
that we will have to pay eventually anyway as the message bytes will
need to be marshalled into a persistent store.

Need to think about the API for the message store here, I'm assuming
that records will not hold references to the file objects but will
get them from a StoreManager or similar by SequenceNumber. Probably
the best way to add a record to the store is via a method like this:

    Record record = ...
    MessageStore store = MessageStore.getInstance();
    byte[] bytes = record.getAsBytes(); // new method!
    store.add(record.getSequenceNumber(), bytes);

### Polish!	

This means ensuring that there are no unrequired PMD warnings on the
source.

* This means fixing ALL of the FIXME level comments in the code.

* This means ensuring that the docs and release notes are up to
  date.

* This means considering adding Lint4J to the build and fixing
  anything that it suggests, although it may be better to add this
  as part of 1.7 instead.

### Bug Fix!

There is a bug in the FontChooser that causes the size to reset
whenever the family or style is changed.

There should be no open bugs in the bug tracker on SF.

## Release 1.7

There isn't really a target release date for 1.7 yet, but assume
sometime in Q1 2007.

### Move Preferences to a Dedicated Dialog

Get rid of the configure menu. Think about how preferences will be
organized, bearing in mind the long term plan to move to something
like an OSGi runtime. The trick here is to move to something that
would then be easy to port to the OSGi system.

Ideally this would use the java.util.prefs classes but the default
implementations suck big time. Look into how much work it would be
to implement our own preferences class.

If there is a 'facade' of JavaBeans over the underlying preferences
classes then it becomes easy to use binding & validation to present
a user interface.

Include an option to show date & time vs. only time in the ledger.

* Create a panel to allow configuration of fonts & colours.

* Create a panel to allow configuration of date & time views.

### Add an Export Dialog

Have the different export formats available via a combo box.

### Move to a Single FilterLedger Action with a Dedicated Dialog

Have edit filter and filter by selection actions. Filter by
selection should try to produce a filter matching all selected
records.

The first time filter is applied it should work like filter by
selection, aftwerwards it should edit the current filter.

### Prepare All Strings for I18N

A neat idea would be to write a script that automatically creates
transaltions via google. Of course these should be checked by hand
if possible before shipping.

Note that at this stage we're just talking about strings, not icons
or other resources (i.e. documentation).

* Speak to Orjan L about getting a Swedish translation.

* Speak to Jone A about getting a Norwegian translation.

## Release 2.0

There isn't really a target release date for 2.0 yet, but assume
sometime towards the end of 2007, exactly when depends on how
ambitious we get with new features.

### Move to Either the Java SPI or OSGi Runtime Mechanism

See the [Sun web site][JSPI] for details. Also note that the Service
class is `sun.misc.Service`. Or, a possibly better but more
intrusive change would be switch to an [OSGi runtime][OSGI],
possibly [Equinox][EE] from Eclipse or the [Knopflerfish][KF] OSGi
runtime. Using OSGi in this way would make these mechanisms
extension points for a 'core' bundle.

* The export/marshalling mechanism.

* The action manager.

  This may or may not be a good idea, it could be a neat way to
  allow custom actions to be added however. This would ideally need
  a means of adding custom actions to the menu bar and tool bar,
  which would either need these to be built up dynamically or at
  least have well known "addition" points in them.


* A mechanism for displaying custom data types in a smart manner.

* To be used in the ledger and detail views.

* Filters to be used when searching and matching record types.

* Possibly ledger persistence providers.

  This should probably be added after 2.0, either as a point release
  or in the next major revision.

### Break out utilities and make them a dependency


The utilities should be available from ianp.org and stored in
subversion there. All of the utilities should be standalone. Allow
the status bar to depend on Logger though.

A (probably better) alternative is to include commons-lang as a
dependency. This could be done much earlier (maybe include both
commons-logging and commons-lang when BDBJE is removed).

### Add LedgerSnoop Tool Based on TIB Ledger Viewer Type Idea

### Add Support for Flying Saucer and use that to Display Help, &c.

Not too sure how useful this will be in practice, it may make more
sense to clean up the browserlauncher code and stick with that. An
alternative would be go move to a JavaHelp based system.

### Add in Support for Persistent Message Stores.

I'm unclear as to when this should happen, in 1.7 or 2.0? Probably
2.0 as it'll be a big change. What follows is some thinking based on
the use of BDBJE as a messaage store and other ideas, I'm not sure
all of them are good ones!

An alternative to [BDBJE] would be to just use a simple on disk
serialization format. Or maybe a hybrid of the two. Use BDBJE for
the meta-data (any free text indexes!) and serialize the actual
messages to disk, this could be handled via the serialization format
or just by writing the raw toByteArray() output to a file. I'd
prefer to use the serialization format but provide a utility to
strip it if required (Snoop Serialized Object or xxxxxx.sso for the
file name).

Record may need to have 2 IDs, one for the original sequenceNumber
(as used to persist the record) and another for the rowNumber, which
would allow for records being deleted.

Look into using deferred write databases, maybe as a configuration
option. Do a sync on a scheduled basis, or every X messages maybe.

* Look at the RecordSelection code to reuse in tuplebindings.

* For stream format use:

      RVMBSF01 - magic string - RV message byte stream format
      int - number of messages
      ...

  For each message use

      RVMBSF02 - magic string
      connection - connection - store as name or serialized data?
      long - timestamp
      bytebuffer - message.toByteArray()
      ...

* Or maybe just use a disk based storage mechanism and Lucene?

  This would probably need some sort of minimal indexing scheme to
  map records to row numbers, and vice versa. Fields in the record
  would become document fields in the lucene index. If it makes
  lucene faster, it may still make sense to use a BDB backed index.

### Write a *much* Better XHTML Exporter

Get rid of the marshaller code, but still allow a custom marshalling
hook to be used for exporting though.

Provide a smart JavaScript & CSS library with the reports to allow
collapsible trees to be used in the table, and table sorting. Embed
the JS & CSS though, don't use separate files.

### Add in Support for JList as well as JTree based subject views

Like the package explorer in IntelliJ. This could maybe be done with
a 'SubjectViewProvider' SPI.

### Add a Real Submit Bug Action and Dialog


Maybe. This would require logging in to SF and submitting the
correct form values. It should be possible using Commons HTTP
Client. Or moving to a different provider of 'project services'.

### Add a Preview Accessory to the File Chooser

This should show the project name and a list of connections.

### Add Charting

This should allow arbitrary fields from arbitrary subject patterns
to be added to a chart. This will need a simple way of referring to
fields from messages, it should be possible to set up a chart by
clicking on a sample message and selecting some fields. Maybe "Add
Probe..." to add a data capture probe, this could then be plotted on
a chart. Probes could be added via an SPI interface.

The code to select fields in a message should be generic, and should
ideally be compiled rather than parsed at each invocation, this way
it could be used to grab fields from a "causal chain" as well. Maybe
make it XPath based using either Saxon-B or Jaxen?

### Make Minimum Java Version 1.5

Should be OK since TIBCO will have been 1.5 based for at least a
year by the time 2.0 is released.

Probably rearrange the package names to be org.rvsnoop instead of
rvsnoop while we are at it.

This will allow us to easily use the JavaBeans binding (JSR-295) and
Fabric app framework, although we would want to modify them
slightly. Although, if we move to OSGi we won't need the Fabric
framework; and I'm starting to think that JGoodies Forms & Binding
are better than GroupLayout & JSR-295, so we may want to stick with
those.

The SwingX stuff is cool though.

### Upgrade Ant to 1.7 and Clean up Build Script (again!)

Ant 1.7 should make e.g. SVN support better. Also, I'm guessing that
the move to OSGi will make the build process quite a bit more
convoluted!

## Unspecified Future Version (Refactoring)

These features should probably be blogged about to solicit feedback,
then they can be slotted in to releases as demanded. Note that some
of these ideas are pretty pie-in-the-sky but it's good to try to
keep track of them somewhere!

### Improve RecordMatcher

Generalize it to NamedMatcher. Add a method for isValueValid which could be used in GUI validators. Or throw an exception for invalid values.

### Move to Using MultiSplitPane for the Main Window Layout

Create a project based on MultiSplitPane but ported to Java 1.4.2
(maybe). Enhance this so that it has collapsible panes and named
panes. Look at iTunes for UI design. Move RvSnoop to use this
project instead of nested JSplitPanes

### Add a Whole Bunch of JUnit Tests

This should get easier as the ledger is separated out more cleanly.
Probably as part of 1.7 we should start moving things towards the
required layout for OSGi, then we can start adding tests based on
that.

### Add a View to Display XML Documents as Text

Use styled text to provide highlighting for elements, etc. nShould
there be preferences to display XML inline in the details view?
Should it be a context action to view in a new window? Or a
double-click action on XML document fields?

### Write a Custom Look & Feel

Base this on PlasticXP, use the gradient caching stuff from
Mustang's Synth L&F. This is really a *lot* of work, but maybe some
features could be written independently and used as stand alone UI
delegates?

### Draw Custom Icons

This, of course, assumes that I have some artistic skill, which is
probaly bullshit!

### Add a "Tip of the day" Dialog

Or maybe a "Productivity Tips" progress dialog like IntelliJ IDEA uses.

### Integrate a Rules Engine

A first step towards features like this may be to generalize and
expand the matcher support. Split things like record types into
matchers and actions.

### Separate out the User Guide and the Web Site

These really should be different, even if there is some overlap
(e.g. FAQ). Specifically, look at some of the advice on the Google
Analytics site to improve naviagtion and content on the site. the
web site should have more overview information, some use-cases for
rvSnoop, and less actual product docs. the product docs should be
more in-depth, especially moving towards 2.0.

Looking at the browsers visiting the site it really needs to look
good in IE 6.0! At the same time, the local docs could be XHTML
displayed via Flying Saucer.

Everybody seems to use fucking massive monitors! So it's not at all
a problem going to an 800x600 or 1024x768 based layout.

### Add More Visualizations for Data

For example, add [sparklines][SL] to the subject explorer tree to
represent message rates and bytes. Probably a good idea to buy the
[new Tufte book][BE] for ideas.
