    <h2>Changes up to version 1.6.0 (Released 2006-12-12)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added an option to republish records to different
        connections.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added actions to export and import records to a binary
        file format (the records are stored in a ZIP based file,
        they are stored as wire format messages with some
        additional metadata).
      </li>
      <li>
        Added an action to remove connections from the list. Also, added
        some options to the connection list context menu to access the
        recent connections list.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a dialog to allow the user to configure different
        record types. The underlying code to support this was
        present in 1.5, but there was no way to access it short
        of editing the saved project file by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        The build system no longer strips out unused classes
        from the included libraries. This increases the size of
        the download but in some cases the licenses of included
        libraries require this, and it simplifies the build
        process, which is a Good Thing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added in dependencies on
        <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/">Commons Lang</a>
        and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/io/">Commons IO</a>.
        Removing some custom utility classes. Since RvSnoop uses the
        Apache license it seems that playing well with the Apache
        libraries is a nice thing to do. Removed the dependency on Berkeley
        DB at the same time. The plan was to use it for the disk based
        project layout, but the plan has changed!
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Changes up to version 1.5.3 (Released 2006-05-22)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Context sensitive menus now work correctly on Windows XP.
      </li>
      <li>
        Export actions are now enabled correctly based on classpath.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Changes up to version 1.5.2 (Released 2006-05-08)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Release 1.5.1 introduced a possible null pointer exception in
        the message ledger rendering code, this is now fixed.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Changes up to version 1.5.1 (Released 2006-05-07)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Fixed bug in message format that prevented nested messages from
        being labelled correctly in the details panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        No longer set forground colour if record is selected in ledger,
        previously the selected message could be hard to read if the
        record type colour was similar to the highlight colour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhanced message ledger render so that it now uses an
        appropriate date &amp; time format depending on the width of the
        timestamp column. Accordingly, the ‘configure date’ menu
        option has been removed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added credits for the various open source libraries which are
        used (with links).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Changes up to version 1.5.0 (Released 2006-04-14)</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added a ‘Connection List’ showing all of the <acronym>RVD</acronym>
        connections and their status. The tooltip for each list item shows the
        subscribed subjects (if any).
      </li>
      <li>
        The details view now shows more information about the message in a
        header panel.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added a <em>limited</em> republishing capability, currently it is
        possible to select messages in the ledger and republish them to the
        same subject and transport. In future it will also be possible to edit
        messages before publishing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added menu options for ‘Export to RvTest’ and ‘Export to RvScript’
        which replace the generic text option.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed bug causing new subject explorer nodes to be created with
        incorrect selection state.
      </li>
      <li>
        The configuration is now in 2 parts: application preferences (window
        size &amp; position, font, etc.) and project preferences (connection
        details, etc.). The application preferences are now persisted
        automatically instead of requiring a user action.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fixed a bug which caused the export actions to sometimes be enabled
        even if the required classes were missing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some re-organization of the menu structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Moved the static methods from the connection manager to the connection
        class, there was no requirement for a seperate class there.
      </li>
      <li>
        Renamed all of the classes to use a more sensible class/package
        structure.
      </li>
      <li>
        The subject explorer no longer displays the satellite dish icons.
      </li>
      <li>
        The details pane now shows the wire size of the message instead of the
        number of top level fields.
      </li>
      <li>
        The details pane now shows the field type as a tool tip.
      </li>
    </ul>
