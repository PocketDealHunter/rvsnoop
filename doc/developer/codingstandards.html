    <h1>Coding Standards &amp; Organization</h1>
    <p>
      Generally the <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/index.html">Sun
      Java Code Conventions</a> are followed. There are some additional
      conventions over and above those recommended by Sun. First, the file
      header comment contains some additional information, an example of this
      is shown below.
    </p>
    <pre>
/*
 * Class:     FilteredLedgerView

    </pre>
    <p>
      Indents are 4 spaces as per the conventions, but in addition tabs are
      not used (set your editor to always use spaces, sometimes called ‘soft
      tabs’). Ternary expressions are displayed on a single line or wrapped
      over three lines (never two). Differing from the Sun conventions,
      <code>if</code> statements can be compressed onto a single line if they
      are short, but the line should still include the braces. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
if (filtering &amp;&amp; subjectFilter != null) { return; }
    </pre>
    <p>
      When it comes to comments all public and protected methods and variables
      should have a complete doc comment, they are optional for private and
      default methods and variables. Short doc comments are compressed onto a
      single line. Numeric literals can be used if they make sense without
      additional documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Care should be taken to include additional blank lines sparingly, I
      develop RvSnoop on a laptop so screen real estate is at a premium.
    </p>
    <h2>Code Layout</h2>
    <p>
      The code is split between two directories: <em>src</em> holds all of the
      application code, while <em>tests</em> holds all of the unit tests. The
      package structure in the two directories is identical. Packages start
      with the prefix <em>org.rvsnoop</em>, although some of the older classes
      do not follow this convention they will be migrated to it over time. The
      code is split between three packages, roughly speaking equivalent to the
      three components in the model, view, controller pattern.
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>org.rvsnoop</dt>
      <dd>
        This holds the ‘model’ classes, the application entry point, and some
        small utility classes. It corresponds, roughly speaking, to the ‘M’
        portion of the MVC pattern.
      </dd>
      <dt>org.rvsnoop.actions</dt>
      <dd>
        This holds all of the actions used by RvSnoop, it corresponds to the
        ‘C’ portion of the MVC pattern. Some small actions are set up and used
        as inner classes in the other packages as well.
      </dd>
      <dt>org.rvsnoop.ui</dt>
      <dd>
        This holds all of the user interface components, it corresponds to the
        ‘V’ in MVC.
      </dd>
    </dl>
