    <h1>RvSnoop @version@ Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    <p>
      If you are reading a local copy of this list the current questions and
      answers may be found at <a href="http://rvsnoop.org/faq.html">the web
      site</a>
    </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>I cannot start RvSnoop, what is wrong?</dt>
      <dd>
        First, check that you have the appropriate classpath set for the Java
        libraries that are required. If the classpath is set correctly it is
        possible that you need to configure the library path to find the
        native Rendezvous libraries. The launch scripts should give you enough
        information to locate and set this correctly.
      </dd>
      <dt>How do I configure the format of the timestamp column?</dt>
      <dd>
        The timestamp column in the ledger will automatically use the most
        appropriate format for it’s width, just resize the column until you
        see your desired format.
      </p>
      <dt>Whay are the RvScript or RvTest export options disabled?</dt>
      <dd>
        You need to set the <code>RVSCRIPT_HOME</code> or
        <code>RVTEST_HOME</code> environment variables, you could edit the
        launch script to set these if you do not want to alter your global
        environment settings. Also, the oldest version of RvScript that has
        been tested is 1.23, so you may need to upgrade if you are using an
        older version.
