RvSnoop is cross platform and will run anywhere there is a suitable [Java virtual machine][J].\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\nRvSnoop is built with [Ant][A], just run `ant` from the root directory.\r\n\r\nAll of the open-source dependencies are already included in the lib directory so there is nothing to worry about there.\r\n\r\nThe TIBCO proprietary dependencies are expected to be in the standard `/opt/tibco` location, if they are not then you may create a build.properties file with alternate paths, look at the `init` target in `build.xml` for information about how to set this up.\r\n\r\n[R]: http://tibco.com/\r\n[J]: http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/\r\n[A]: http://ant.apache.org/"}
